## Tasks Overview

- **Task 1 : Titanic Survival Prediction**
    - **Objective** : Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
        passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
    - **Description** : This task involves handling missing values, correcting
        data types, removing duplicates, and other preprocessing steps to prepare the
        dataset for analysis.
    - **Files** : 
        - 'TASK_1.ipynb'
        - 'Titanic-Dataset.csv' 

- **Task 2 : Movie Rating Prediciton with Python**
    - **Objective** : Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
        features like genre, director, and actors.
    - **Description** : The goal is to analyze
        historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating 
        given to a movie by users or critics.
    - **Files** : 
        - 'TASK_2.ipynb'
        - 'IMDb Movies India.csv'

- **Task 3 : IRIS Flower Classification**
    - **Objective** : To train a machine learning model that can learn from
        these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
        their respective species.
    - **Description** : Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris
        flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
        measurements.
    - **Files** : 
        - 'TASK_3.ipynb'
        - 'IRIS.csv'

- **Task 4 : Sales Predicition using Python**
    - **Objective** : To utilize machine
        learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
        us to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs.
    - **Description** : Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product
        that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
        advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
        advertising platform selection.
    - **Files** : 
        - 'TASK_4.ipynb'
        - 'advertising.csv'

- **Task 5 : Credit Card Fraud Detection**
    - **Objective** : Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
        transactions. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression
        or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
    - **Description** : Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
        imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - **Files** : 
        - 'TASK_5.ipynb'
        - 'creditcard.csv'
